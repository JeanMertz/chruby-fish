# chruby-fish

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JeanMertz/chruby-fish.svg?branch=master)][ci]

Thin wrapper around [chruby][] to make it work with the [Fish shell][]

## install

**note** that `chruby-fish` is dependent on `chruby`, please
[install it first][].

```bash
wget -O chruby-fish-0.8.2.tar.gz https://github.com/JeanMertz/chruby-fish/archive/v0.8.2.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chruby-fish-0.8.2.tar.gz
cd chruby-fish-0.8.2/
sudo make install
```

### Homebrew

chruby-fish can also be installed with [homebrew][]:

```sh
brew install chruby-fish
```

Or the absolute latest chruby-fish can be installed from source:

```sh
brew install chruby-fish --HEAD
```

chruby is installed as a dependency of chruby-fish, if you installed chruby
manually, add the `--without-chruby` flag to the above commands.

### Arch Linux

chruby-fish is included in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chruby-fish/):

```sh
yay -S chruby-fish
```

## configuration

Add the following line to your `config.fish` file:

```sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.fish
```

To enable auto-switching, also add the `auto.fish` file:

```sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.fish
```

Homebrew uses different paths for Intel and Apple Silicon based Macs, you should configure your `config.fish` file accordingly. More about it [here][brew path documentation]

If you use a custom install location for chruby, use the
[`CHRUBY_ROOT` variable][chruby_root] to point in the right direction.

For more general instructions, see the [chruby documentation][].
